What is Ganz
The Ganz project is a crypto-games platform that allows players to explore games, store all of their gaming data in a single profile, and manage and sell their in-game assets.

And from the developers' side, Ganz is also attempting to ease the blockchain game development process by creating a framework that will suit the demands of most blockchain games.

it's a place where you can publish your game and use some features to simplify your development. For players - single space for all their games.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Terra landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Open a new income stream for developers, create NFT revenue

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

consumers - Gamers, Developers

- What need(s) does your project meet?

We can see that the crypto-gaming industry is rapidly expanding. Every day, a growing number of people join this community, whether as players or as creators of exceptional gaming projects. People are always looking for new and exciting games to play. However, while they may discover regular games on traditional gaming platforms, crypto games are distributed independently, making it substantially more difficult for gamers to locate and manage them.

The Ganz project aims to solve this problem by creating a crypto-games platform that allows users to explore games, store all of their gaming data in a single profile, and manage and trade their in-game assets.
